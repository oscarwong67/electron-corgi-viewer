# Electron /r/Corgi Viewer

Built off of @jaredpalmer's https://github.com/jaredpalmer/electron-starter Electron Starter.

## Imgur and Electron
An electron application that fetches the top posts of the week from imgur.com/r/corgi, and displays them in a grid.

If you'd like to run the app, clone the project and run:

`npm i`
`npm start`

In the project root.
